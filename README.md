# Inspired for Women

At Inspired for Women, we make clothing as a statement.

Men can go grab a pair of jeans based on their exact waist and inseam length, yet we're stuck trying to figure out if two dresses in the same size from different brands will both fit us right or now.

## NO MORE.

As a woman-run company, we are tired of owning clothes ranging from XS-XL due to company's vanity sizing and the lack of regulation in clothing sizes.
