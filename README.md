# Inspired for Women

At Inspired for Women, we make clothing as a statement.

Men can go grab a pair of jeans based on their exact waist and inseam length, yet we're stuck trying to figure out if two dresses in the same size from different brands will both fit us right or now.

## NO MORE.

As a woman-run company, we are tired of owning clothes ranging from XS-XL due to company's vanity sizing and the lack of regulation in clothing sizes.

At Inspired For Women, you get to choose handmade items at affordable prices that are made exactly for your measurements. 

To order:
- Navigate to the website and browse our items.
- Add items to your cart and click Checkout to get your Order ID.
- Have your exact measurements on hand for the items you want custom created for you.
- Email your Order ID and your measurements to inspiredbywomen@gmail.com and we'll confirm your order and send you updates as your masterpieces are being created.
